# Cyberpunk Damage Tracker

This is a simple command line style program designed as a tool to track stats and simplify rolling for the Cyberpunk 2020 TRPG ruleset, it has support for multiple ammo types, regular and called shots, full auto, and supports cyberlimb SDPs. It also allows for saving and loading of characters to track via a simple text format. My group uses a heavily modified ruleset and equipment list compared to base 2020, so be aware that a lot of the damage ordering and ammo type effects likely differ from the core ruleset.

To use this tool simply run DTMain.py in the root of this repository
